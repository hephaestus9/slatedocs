To make basic changes to the sizes, padding, and colors, you can edit `_variables.scss`. If you don't need to make any major changes, this is the preferred way to edit Slate, since it makes updating Slate a little easier.

If you want to make more significant changes to Slate's look and feel, feel free to dive into `screen.css.scss` and `print.css.scss` (the print stylesheet). They're fairly well documented and organized, but if you need some help, feel free to submit an issue.

Some people have done some cool heavy styling on their Slate pages â€” you can take a look at their Slate sources below.
