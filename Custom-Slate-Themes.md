To make basic changes to the sizes, padding, and colors, you can edit `variables.scss`. If you don't need to make any major changes, this is the preferred way to edit Slate, since it makes updating Slate a little easier.

If you want to make more significant changes to Slate's look and feel, feel free to dive into `screen.css.scss` and `print.css.scss` (the print stylesheet). They're fairly well documented and organized, but if you need some help, feel free to submit an issue.
