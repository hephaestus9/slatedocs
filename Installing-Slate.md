### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **Ruby, version 1.9.3 or newer**
 - **Bundler** â€” If Ruby is already installed, but the `bundle` command doesn't work, just run `gem install bundler` in a terminal.

### Getting Set Up

 1. Fork this repository on Github.
 2. Clone *your forked repository* (not our original one) to your hard drive with `git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/slate.git`
 3. `cd slate`
 4. Install all dependencies: `bundle install`
 5. Start the test server: `bundle exec middleman server`

You can now see the docs at <http://localhost:4567>. And as you edit `source/index.md`, your server should automatically update! Whoa! That was fast!

### What Now?

The next step is to [learn how to edit `source/index.md` to change the content of your docs](Markdown-Syntax).
