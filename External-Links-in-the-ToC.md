You can add links to external sites at the bottom of the Table of Contents. Just edit, at the top of `index.md`:

    toc_footers:
     - <a href='#'>Sign Up for a Developer Key</a>
     - <a href='http://github.com/tripit/slate'>Documentation Powered by Slate</a>

Add more lines or remove lines as needed. If you don't want any footer links at all, just remove `toc_footers` altogether, and the link section should just disappear.
